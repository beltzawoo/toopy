# toopy
## A simple and minimal todo CLI app written in python

### Installing
Use pip or something, will write later (probably)

### Usage
`toopy`: List all tasks
`toopy -a "My Task"`: Add a task
`toopy -r 1`: Remove a task
`toopy --onlyprint`: Like `toopy`, but nice for including in your .rc file (doesn't do anything if there are no tasks)
