# toopy
## A simple and minimal todo CLI app written in python

### Installing
Linux: `sudo python3 setup.py install`

Windows/Mac: Not sure, maybe try a variant of the above without `sudo`

### Usage
`toopy`: List all tasks

`toopy -a "My Task"`: Add a task

`toopy -r 1`: Remove a task

`toopy --onlyprint`: Like `toopy`, but nice for including in your .rc file (doesn't do anything if there are no tasks)
